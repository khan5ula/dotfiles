</p>

<p align="center">All natural pine, faux fur and a bit of soho vibes for the classy minimalist</p>

## Usage

1. Git clone this repo or download as .zip `https://github.com/RosieZiutka/rose-pine-polybar.git`
2. Comment out (using ";;") or delete your current colors in config file.
3. Add something like following line to your polybar config file: `include-file = ~/Path-to-where-you-downloaded/theme-name.ini`, of course replace those with real path and file names

**NOTE** It would be good practice if you copied your file to `.config/polybar/` instead of using the path you downloaded.
